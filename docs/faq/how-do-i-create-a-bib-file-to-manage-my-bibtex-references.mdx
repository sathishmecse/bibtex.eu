## Creating a bib file by hand

Creating a `.BIB file` is actually quite simple. All you need to do is create a text file with the `.bib` extension. You can then add your BibTeX references to this file, one per line. For example:


```latex
@article{sathis2023,
	title        = {CLASSIFICATION OF HEART BLOCKAGE USING PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION BASED PROBABILISTIC NEURAL NETWORK},
	author       = {SATHISHKUMAR.S,DEVI PRIYA.R, KARTHIKA.K},
	year         = {2023},
	journal      = {TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTER SCIENCES}

}
```



Once you have your `.BIB file` created, you can then use it in your LaTeX documents by specifying the `\bibliography{filename}` command. For example:


```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{natbib}

\begin{document}

...

\bibliography{filename}

\end{document}
```

That's all there is to it! Creating a `.BIB file` is a simple way to manage your BibTeX references. Be sure to check out our other articles on BibTeX for more tips and tricks!
